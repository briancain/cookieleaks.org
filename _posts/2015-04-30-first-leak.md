title: First Leak
---

In early March of 2015, user [cookie0man](https://instagram.com/cookie0man) leaked the first photo of cotton candy oreos. We were able to get our hands on a package of these limited edition leaked cookies at CookieLeaks headquarters thanks to an anonymous source who left the package on our front door.

## Impressions

Here are some unfiltered impressions from our cookie tasting experts:

> _I see we have a two color cream situation here_

> _The cream seems less viscous than a regular oreo....or is it more viscous?_

> _I did notice the slight fluffiness to the cream_

> _Bleecheh!_

> _A dream come true_

> _I feel like I'm at disney land_

> _Is this real? I'm so intregued by this._

> _It was bizzare but I kind of liked it_

> _Is this real food?_

## The opening

__Takeaway:__ You could smell the sugar the moment the package was opened.

## Leaked ingredients

We found a list of ingredients on the back of the package. Here they are:

> __Ingredients:__ Unbleached enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate (vitamin b1), riboflavin (vitamin b2), folic acid), sugar, palm and/or canola oil, dextrose, high fructose corn syrup, cornstarch, salt, baking soda, artificial and natural flavor, soy lecithin, artificial color (red 40 lake, blue 1 lake).

Unfortunately, we were not leaked what was in the _natural and artificial_ flavors, which likely gave the cookie its cotton candy taste.
